Node: JavaScript runtime used to execute code outside of the browser

Express: Library that runs in the node runtime. Has helpers to make dealing with
HTTP traffic easier

Everything in express, in theory can be used in Node from scratch

When you run some server, your server will listen to http traffic on a single individual
port

Port: a door through which traffic (http request) can be routed

Node will get the request and hand it into express

Express looks at the request and decides what chunk of code will 'handle' or respond
to the request

Route handlers are used to handle http request that are asking for a every specific
service

Route handlers will send response back to node after handling the http request
