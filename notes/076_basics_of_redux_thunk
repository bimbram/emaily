-The entire purpose of redux thunk is to allow us to create an action creator
which does not immediately return an action

-redux thunk is giving the action creator a direct access into dispatch function
at any point in time

-dispatch sends the action to all different reducers in the store causing them
to instantly recalculate the app state
