1. passportJS will automate our request to google

-Two passport weaknesses:
1. not automate the entire thing, that is why we must add manual code
2. there are more than one passport library

passport library components
-passport: general helpers for handling auth in express apps
-passport strategy: helpers for authenticating with one very specific method
(email/password, Google, facebook)
